hxClosure - Google Closure Wrappers for haxe

In development.

Find the generated haxe external classes in classes.

Create.hx is the generator. It reads the "serialized" file, converted
to haxe serialisation format (from json) as it's much much quicker
than reading json in haxe. I haven't provided the original json to
save my space on git hub but you can deserialise or run jsdoc on the
closure documentation with my publish function in bdtemplate.

There are a number of excluded files, missing methods yet, but it's
moving in the correct direction.

What's happening should be fairly obvious from Create.hx.

For testing

    haxe make.hxml (create the generator in create.n
    neko create.n (run the generator on "serialised")
    haxe goog.hxml (see if the compiled classes compile)


TODO
----

- I think a top level Goog.hx to mimic the function in the namespace
  goog is next. 

- Property generation is currently commented out, as it' producing
  compiler errors due to duplicate definitions in base classes.

Cheers
