hxClosure - Google Closure Wrappers for haxe

In development.

Find the generated haxe external classes in classes.

Create.hx is the generator. It reads the "serialized" file, converted to haxe serialisation format as it's much much quicker than reading json in haxe. I haven't provided the original json to save my space on git hub but you can deserialise or run jsdoc with my publish function in bdtemplate.

There are a number of excluded files, missing methods yet, but it's moving in the correct direction.


Cheers
